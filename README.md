# KIM
Keyboard Image Mapper (KIM)

Simple webapp that maps images to keys to display them upon keypress. Intended to make animating to a rythm more natural. 

# How to use
1. Create a new folder in kim/projects and name it whatever you'd like. 
2. For each frame, copy and paste it in the folder created previously, and assign it to a key by using the file name. Ex: Image for A key would be a.png.
3. run `node kim/server/index.js` and go to localhost:3000 in your browser of choice
4. Enter the name of the folder you created in the project text field and load. 
5. Press keys and enjoy.
